- Scrum	Agile software development framework


#  Introduction
## Purpose and scope
Why was this document made and to whom.
This document should provide the product vision [1] and document high level requirements for the product. When describing the functions and user interface, make it clear to the reader what is the status of the requirements – are the fixed or still evolving.

## Product
Name of the product.
What is the purpose of the product? What are its benefits?
For whom is the product developed (who is the customer)?
What is the environment: is the product independent or part of a larger whole? (using environment)

#  General description
## Functionalities
Brief description of the product characteristics: what in general is meant to be developed?

## User characteristics
Who will use the product? Describe the user types and groups by occupation, role (include administrative and other roles). What is the programs frequency of use (daily, hourly, once a week…), where do the users fall in the company organization, etc?

## Environment and design constraints
Are there hardware or software constraints? If the product only works in a specified hardware or software setup, describe them here.

Are third party components used, what about their licensing?

Outline of the technologies that are used in the product – what is their purpose, how are they used.

Does your product have critical hardware, software or communication interfaces?  Briefly describe them here.

Do you need to follow certain standards?

# Assumptions
What assumptions are made of the system.


#  Quality goals
In this Chapter you will describe the quality requirements of your product and their associated goals. You should describe the quality requirements that are valid for YOUR product – each product has different emphasis on quality aspects. Remove those goals that do not apply for your product and add goals, if necessary (i.e.. maintainability, portability)

## Usability goals
What target does your product have in terms of usability and user experience? What are the most critical aspects? How and when do you measure if the goals have been reached?

### Goal 1
### Goal 2
### Performance goals
### Reliability goals
### Security goals

#  Functional requirements
In this Chapter you will describe the high level functional requirements of your product. Requirements are described so that the reader will understand what needs to be implemented, what the product does and so that backlog can be mapped to requirements. It is not necessary to describe functions in such a detailed level that someone else would actually be able to implement them based on this document. The detail must be such though, that you as the developers and the customer will able to form a common understanding of what needs to be developed.

Requirements/functions should be described using, e.g. use cases, user stories or scenarios. Use sections for different types of functions.

# User interface
If user interface design is critical for your system, briefly sketch the main views/states here. Use example pictures of views, menus and dialogs, if possible and appropriate. Use subchapters for different views. Also describe the transitions between the views and the needed interactions for that. The description should be at the level that the reader will have an idea what the user interface will contain, what general design solutions are used and why, and that the team can create prototypes based on it. It should not go to such level of detail that the UI could be fully implemented based on the description.

# Open issues
Are there things that still need to be checked with the customer? Functional requirements that are at status “maybe”? Things depending on user studies?
